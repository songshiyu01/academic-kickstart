I joined TuSimple USA in June, 2021. We are actively hiring now. Ping me if you are interested in building self-driving trucks together with us!

I was one of the founding team members of the Baidu Autonomous Driving Car project. I joined Baidu in 2014. Since Jan. 2016, I was a tech lead at Baidu ADT, recruited and built the map and localization team from scratch. Starting in 2020, I initiated and lead two exploratory pilot projects, pedestrian trajectory prediction and imitation/reinforcement learning-based decision and planning. Prior to joining Baidu, I was a research scientist in the media analysis group in NEC Labs America, Cupertino CA.

My research interests include Computer Vision, Robotics, Machine Learning, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).
